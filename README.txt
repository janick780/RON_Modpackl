Hello, this is a brief tutorial on how to install the standardized modpack for our Ready or Not voice chat.
Please keep in mind that this is all still being tested, and some issues may arise, or something may have been overlooked.
If you are having any issues, please message steam user Jakubian for additional help, I will try and help when possible.
If I fail to respond in a reasonable manner, please try and reach out to me at janicean566@protonmail.com. I usually check that daily.
Without fruther ado, I shall go over the instructions to install Vortex, the Ready or Not extension, and the subsequent mods.

1. Download the package. Make sure the zip file this txt belongs to is downloaded and installed on your computer.

2. Select the vortex installer, labelled "Vortex-1-1-4-16-1633352164.exe".

3. Run through all steps the vortex launcher needs to setup, if the launcher requests to update, do it. Please note, you do not need to make a nexus
account, or link vortex to any kind of account to get it running, everything is here.

4. Once everything is setup, open vortex, and navigate to the extensions tab.

5. Drag the following files into the "Drop File(s) box in the bottom: "Unreal Engine Mod Installer-153-1-1-0-1597867605.7z", and "ReadyOrNot-Vortex-342-1-1-0-1642616109.zip".
It may make you do one at a time, and restart after each, do so if neccessary. If you see any errors while only one is installed, do not panic. Finish 
installing both, and the errors should disappear.

6. Once done, and no errors show, navigate to the mods section.

7. Take every file not previously used, and drag them into the "Drop File(s)" tab in downloads. This will take a few minutes. Once the mods are installed,
click the "enable all" button on the top right of the screen. This will enable all mods. You may be asked to select which version of a file you want to take.
As of now, that is up to you, but we do not know if this will cause any issues, please let me know if you have any.

8. With all mods enabled, you should be ready to enjoy the modded experience!
